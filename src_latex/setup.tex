The \emph{goal} of our study is to investigate the relation between the occurrence of code smells in JavaScript files and files fault-proneness or vulnerability, as well as the smells survival all along the projects. The \emph{quality focus} is the source code fault-proneness {\color{blue}or vulnerability}, which, if high, can have a concrete effect on the cost of maintenance and evolution of the system. The \emph{perspective} is that of researchers, interested in the relation between code smells and the quality of JavaScript systems. The results of this study are also of interest for developers performing maintenance and evolution activities on JavaScript systems since they need to take
into account and forecast their effort, and to testers, who need to know which files should be tested in priority. Finally, the results of this study can be of interest to managers and quality assurance teams, who could use code smell detection techniques to assess the fault-proneness {\color{blue}or vulnerability} of in-house or to-be-acquired systems, to better quantify
the cost-of-ownership of these systems. The \emph{context} of this study consists of 12 types of code smells identified in {\color{blue}fifteen} JavaScript systems. In the following, we introduce our research questions, describe the studied systems, and present our data extraction approach. Furthermore, we describe our model construction and model analysis approaches.

\textbf{(RQ1) Is the risk of fault higher in files with code smells in comparison with those without code smell?}
Prior works show that code smells increase the fault-proneness of Java classes~\cite{Khomh2012,jaafar2013mining}. Since JavaScript code smells are different from the code smells investigated in these previous studies on Java systems, we are interested in examining the impact that JavaScript code smells can have on the fault-proneness of JavaScript applications.

\textbf{(RQ2) Are JavaScript files with code smells equally fault-prone?}
During maintenance and quality assurance activities, developers are interested in identifying parts of the code that should be tested and--or refactored in priority. Hence, we are interested in identifying code smells that have the most negative impact on JavaScript systems, \ie{} making JavaScript applications more prone to faults.

{\color{blue}\textbf{(RQ3) Is the risk of vulnerability higher in files with code smells in comparison with those without code smell?}
Similarly to RQ1, we are interested in examining the impact that JavaScript code smells can have on the vulnerability of JavaScript applications.
	
\textbf{(RQ4) Are JavaScript files with code smells equally vulnerable?}
Similarly to RQ2, we are interested in identifying code smells that have the most negative impact on JavaScript systems, \ie{} making JavaScript applications more vulnerable.
	
\textbf{(RQ5) How do the smells survive over time?}
We are interested here in knowing the genealogy of the smells of project, in order to have a better idea of how long those smells survive, if they are persistent, when they are created during the process life of files, and which are the most dangerous.

\subsection{Studied Systems}
In order to address our research questions, we perform a case study with the following {\color{blue}fifteen} open source JavaScript projects. Table~\ref{studiedsystems} summarizes the characteristics of our subject systems.\\
\textbf{Express}\footnote{https://github.com/expressjs/express} is a minimalist web framework for Nodejs. It is one of the most popular libraries in NPM \cite{mardan2014express} and it is used in production by IBM, Uber and many other companies\footnote{https://expressjs.com/en/resources/companies-using-express.html}. Its Github repository has over 5,300 commits and more than 200 contributors. It has been forked 5,900 times and starred more than 32,500 times. Express is also one of the most dependent upon libraries on NPM with over 8,800 dependents. There are more than 2,400 closed Github issues on their repository.\\
\textbf{Bower.io}\footnote{https://github.com/bower/bower} is a package manager for client-side libraries.
It is a command line tool which was originally released as part of Twitter's open source effort\footnote{https://engineering.twitter.com/opensource} in 2012 \cite{bowerabout}.

The Github repository of Grunt is starred by more than 11,000 users. More than 60 contributors made over 1,400 commits into this project. They also managed to have more than 1,000 closed issues on their github repository. We selected these projects because they are among the most popular NPM libraries, in terms of the number of installs. They have a large size and possess a Github repository with issue tracker and wiki. They are also widely used in production.\\
{\color{blue}
\textbf{Jquery}\footnote{https://github.com/jquery/jquery} is a famous JavaScript library, created to make easier the writing of client-side scripts in the HTML of web pages.
